## This is my initial work on the v3 API, it is not fully tested and is only compatible with Flex v2.5.x Radios. I'm in the process of moving 350 miles so I won't be doing much with this for the next 60 days or so (until ~ October, 2019). I am very thankful for all of you who have tried this software and/or reported issues back to me. Please be patient, I'll be back after my move settles down.

Please see the v2 Branch of this repo for a version that is compatible with pre-v2.5.x Radios.
A Future version of this library will support all Radio versions.

Flex Radios can have one of four different version groups:
*  v1.x.x, the v1 API
*  v2.0.x thru v2.4.9, the v2 API <<-- supported by the v2 branch
*  v2.5.1 to less than v3.0.0, the v3 API without MultiFlex <<-- supported by the v3 branch
*  v3.x.x, the v3 API with MultiFlex <<-- supported by the v3 branch (in the future)



This framework provides most of the capability of FlexLib but does not provide an identical  interface due to the  
differences between the Windows and macOS environments and system services.

The "xLib6000 Overview.pdf" file in the Documentation folder contains an overview of the structure of this framework  
and an explanation of the Tcp and Udp data flows.  

The following apps are all built on this framework:

If you require a DEBUG build you will have to build from sources.
