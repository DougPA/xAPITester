# xLib6000
## Mac implementation of the FlexRadio (TM) series 6000 software defined radios API (FlexLib)

Builds on macOS 10.13.3 using XCode 9.2 (9c40b) using Swift 4 with a Deployment
Target of macOS 10.10

NOTE: The Swift 4 Branch has been eliminated, the Master Branch is now the sole repository.

This version includes the library-side code to support SmartLink (see xAPITester or xSDR6000 for
an example of the client-side code needed to implement SmartLink).

Version 1.0.1 is a reorganization of the file structure to reflect the use of Common Code between this
framework and xAPITesterSL and xSDR6000

==========================================================================

This framework provides most of the capability of FlexLib but does not 
provide an identical interface due to the differences between the Windows
and macOS environments and system services.

CocoaAsyncSocket is embedded in this project as source code
(version 7.6.1 as of 2017-06-24
see https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket)

Once compiled, the framework should be placed in a folder on your Mac where
frameworks can be referenced (typically ~/Library/Frameworks)

A compiled DEBUG build framework is contained in the GitHub Release if
you would rather not build from sources.

If you require a RELEASE build you will have to build from sources.
