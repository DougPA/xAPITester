This version supports SmartLink (TM).

Please see the xAPITester.pdf file in this project or run the app and click
the HELP menu choice. (---- somewhat out of date but still useful----)

A compiled RELEASE build executable (with SwiftyUserDefaults.framework embedded in it)
is contained in the GitHub Release if you would rather not build from sources.

If you require a DEBUG build you will have to build from sources and will need:

SwiftyUserDefaults.framework ( available at https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults )
xLib6000.framework (available at https://github.com/DougPA/xLib6000)
