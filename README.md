This version supports SmartLink (TM).


Usage:

Please see the xAPITester.pdf file in this project or run the app and click  
the HELP menu choice. (---- somewhat out of date but still useful----)  

A compiled RELEASE build executable (with SwiftyUserDefaults.framework  and   
xLib6000.framework embedded in it) is contained in the GitHub Release if you   
would rather not build from sources.  

If you require a DEBUG build you will have to build from sources and will need:  

* SwiftyUserDefaults.framework - https://github.com/radex/SwiftyUserDefaults  
* xLib6000.framework - https://github.com/DougPA/xLib6000
