## I'm in the process of moving 350 miles so I won't be doing much with this for the next 60 days or so (until ~ October, 2019). I am very thankful for all of you who have tried this software and/or reported issues back to me. Please be patient, I'll be back after my move settles down. 

Please see the v3 Branch of this repo for a version that is compatible with post-v2.4.9 Radios.
A Future version of this library will support all Radio versions.

Flex Radios can have one of four different version groups:
*  v1.x.x, the v1 API
*  v2.0.x thru v2.4.9, the v2 API <<-- supported by the v2 branch
*  v2.5.1 to less than v3.0.0, the v3 API without MultiFlex <<-- supported by the v3 branch
*  v3.x.x, the v3 API with MultiFlex <<-- supported by the v3 branch (in the future)
